                    <h1>Tom Holland</h1>
                    <p>Thomas Stanley Holland (born 1 June 1996) is an English actor. His accolades include a British
                        Academy Film Award and
                        three Saturn Awards. He featured on the Forbes 30 Under 30 Europe list of 2019. Some
                        publications have called him one of
                        the most popular actors of his generation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Holland's career began at age nine when he enrolled in a dancing class, where a choreographer
                        noticed him and arranged
                        for him to audition for a role in Billy Elliot the Musical at London's Victoria Palace Theatre.
                        After two years of
                        training, he secured a supporting part in 2008 and was upgraded to the title role that year,
                        which he played until 2010.
                        Holland made his film debut in the disaster drama The Impossible (2012) as a teenage tourist
                        trapped in a tsunami, for
                        which he received critical acclaim and a nomination for the Goya Award for Best New Actor. After
                        this, Holland decided
                        to pursue acting as a full-time career, appearing in How I Live Now (2013) and playing
                        historical figures in the film In
                        the Heart of the Sea (2015) and the miniseries Wolf Hall (2015).</p>
